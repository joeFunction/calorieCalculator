### Cal.culator
This is a Group project that I worked on during the bootcamp. It is primarily built from the back end, using JQuery and parsed AJAX calls. 

The theme of this application is based on a macronutrient calculator, which allows you to compare meals based on their macronutrients levels. This assignment breaks up the application's UI into columns, rows, and is responsive to user events.

  ### User Story
    ``
    As a user, I want to be able to compare meals so that I can visualize the macronutrient information to make an informed decision.
    ``
  
  ### Usage

The user would benefit from being able to view data about their favorite meals. It would be particularly helpful to be able to visualize meals in healthy and unhealthy meals categories.

### Functionality

Given a search form, when the user inputs data, a table of macronutrient content should render. 

The user is able to:

  * Input data meal information.

  * Compare meals by using the calculate button.
